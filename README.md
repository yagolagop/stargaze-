# Stargaze

This little project I created is a space magazine. Originally, it was going to be a skate magazine, but I felt that many skate magazines have a similar style, making the pages a bit repetitive. So, instead, I decided to create a space magazine. If there were a hypothetical page dedicated to learning about the universe, I wanted it to be a pleasant and cozy site that helps kids learn in a fun and engaging way.

## Languages I'm Using

For this project, I used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
  
## References

I relied on many ideas from [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/), [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), Wikipedia, and even my mom! :D. I used all the icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

## Considerations

- **HTML**: I think I did well with HTML. I can manage it with ease, but I still find some parts of my code a bit difficult to understand, and I have a lot to learn. HTML is a tool I learned in high school, and at that time, it was the coolest thing I learned. After a while, I stopped practicing HTML, but this year I decided to revisit it from the beginning because I had forgotten many essential concepts.

- **CSS**: Enemies to lovers. I didn't like CSS before, but now it's the tool I use the most. Throughout this project, I enjoyed it even more, though I still have a lot to learn about it. I learned CSS through a government website that helps kids learn programming languages, [JÃ³venes Programadores](https://www.jovenesprogramadores.cl/que-aprenderas/).
  
- **JavaScript**: How I started. I haven't formally studied JavaScript, but for this project, I relied heavily on online resources to help me execute my JavaScript code. Initially, it was a real mess, and I struggled to understand how everything worked. However, I persevered and gradually figured it out.
